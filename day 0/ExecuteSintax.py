#first day (Execute Python Sintax)

#example 1:
print("hello world")
#if we run this code with the top right "triangle" it will give us the word inside the code.
#________python indentation________

#Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
#Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
#Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.


#example 2:
if 5 > 4:
  print("five is greater than four")
#IT WONT WORK WITHOUT THE DOUBLE PERIOD !
  
#Example 3:

if 5 > 2:
 print("five is greater than two")

#its relly up to us how much distance do we need between these 2 command but IT HAS TO BE ATLEAST 1 SPACE.
 
if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!")
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")


#You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:

if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!")
    print("Five is greater than two!")
