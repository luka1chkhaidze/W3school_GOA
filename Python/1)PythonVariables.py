#lets say we got a number and we whant to give a variable to this value(number)
#Example 1:

x = 4
y = 9
print(x,y)

#x and y in this case are varibles, 4 and 9 are values for this variable

#Python has no command for declaring a variable.

#we also have 3 different DATA TYPES

q = 23 #we call this a integer-int
w = "house" #we call this a string-str
e = 0.9 #we call this float

"""
if we whant do not know what data type we got
to handle with, Pyton got us coverd ;)
"""
x = 23
y = "house"
a = 0.9

#we need to know the data type for connectin these Variables to gether

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(a))
#this will show us the data type of theese Variables in the terminal by running the code.
#_________________________________________________________________________________________
# lets do something like this
x = 3
X = 5
print(x,X)

#if there would of been 2 undercase x-is the therinal will put out the last variables value (in this case 3).
x = 2
x = 3
